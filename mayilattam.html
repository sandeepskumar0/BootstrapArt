        Mayilattam (Tamil: மயிலாட்டம்) is an artistic and religious form of dance performed in the Hindu temples of Tamil Nadu[1] in reverence to Lord Subrahmanya.

Mayilattam performers wear costumes from head to toe like peacock with beak, that can be opened and closed using a thread, and perform specific dances. The performers dance on a tall piece of wood attached at the end of their feet. This art requires extensive training and practise. This dance is performed in all Murugan (Lord Subrahmanya) temples as a tradition during festivals. Due to the difficulties in practise and less amount of wages for the dancers, the number of Mayilattam performers is decreasing.[2][3]
