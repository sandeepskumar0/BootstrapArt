    Ghoomar or ghumar is a traditional folk dance of Rajasthan. It was the Bhil tribe who performed it to worship Goddess Saraswati which was later embraced by other Rajasthani communities.[1][2][3][4][5] The dance is chiefly performed by veiled women who wear flowing dresses called ghaghara.[6] The dance typically involves performers pirouetting while moving in and out of a wide circle. The word ghoomna describes the twirling movement of the dancers and is the basis of the word ghoomar.[7][8]
    
    According to the traditional rituals, newly married bride is expected to dance ghoomar on being welcomed to her new marital home.[9] Ghoomar is often performed on special occasions, such as at weddings, festivals and religious occasions.[10] which sometimes lasts for hours.
    
    'Gangaur Ghoomar Dance Academy' was established by Maharani Rajmata Goverdhan Kumari of Santrampur in 1986, to preserve and promote ghoomar folk dance.[11][12] The Government of India awarded her the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2007, for her contributions to arts.[13]</P>
