        <p><justify>Mohiniyattam, (Malayalam: മോഹിനിയാട്ടം), is an Indian classical dance form that developed and remained popular in the state of Kerala.[1][2] Kathakali is another classical dance form of Kerala.[3][4] Mohiniyattam dance gets its name from the word Mohini – a historical enchantress avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu, who helps the good prevail over evil by developing her feminine powers.[1][5]

            Mohiniyattam's roots, like all classical Indian dances, are in the Natya Shastra – the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text on performance arts.[6][7] However, it follows the Lasya style described in Natya Shastra, that is a dance which is delicate, eros-filled and feminine.[2][8] It is traditionally a solo dance performed by women after extensive training, though nowadays men can also perform the dance.[9][10][11][12] The repertoire of Mohiniyattam includes music in the Carnatic style, singing and acting a play through the dance, where the recitation may be either by a separate vocalist or the dancer themselves. The song is typically in Malayalam-Sanskrit hybrid called Manipravalam.[2]</p></justify>
